# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Zero Tolerance Policy

- **NEVER abandon work halfway through** - if something gets difficult, push through it
- **NEVER use `git stash`** to hide incomplete work - fix the problem directly
- **NEVER give up because a task is complex** - break it down and keep going
- If a tool call is rejected, adapt your approach immediately and continue

## Contribution Rules (Mandatory)

These apply to every change and every pull request. They are not negotiable.

### Generated code never repeats across assemblies

- **Never inject fixed code into a consumer.** A helper class, observable, invoker, command bridge or any other
  code whose content does not depend on the call site belongs in a runtime package as public API. Generated code
  references it by its fully qualified name.
- **Never generate a type whose fully qualified name can repeat in another assembly.** With `InternalsVisibleTo`,
  a friend assembly sees both copies. Generated types live in a namespace unique to the assembly.
- **Do not use `RegisterPostInitializationOutput`** or any other output that is the same for every consumer.
- A compiler polyfill that generated code needs (`InterceptsLocationAttribute`, `ModuleInitializerAttribute`) is
  declared `file`-scoped in the file that uses it. Do not ship public polyfills from the runtime: they clash
  (CS0436) with the consumer's own polyfills.

### Never add a package without maintainer approval

Platform-specific code goes in the existing packages under platform target frameworks. Follow ReactiveUI's
layout: platform TFM properties in `Directory.Build.props`, and source folders such as `Platforms/apple-common`,
`Platforms/ios` and `Platforms/mac` that compile only for the matching TFMs.

### Every changed file is fully covered

Every source file a change adds or modifies reaches **100% line and branch coverage for the whole file**, not
only the changed lines. Measure each test project's cobertura report separately and merge them per file. Remove
code no caller can reach rather than testing it. The codecov/patch, codecov/project and SonarCloud quality gates
must all pass.

### Every change runs the examples

Run the full examples suite on every pull request:

- **Linux:** every `Documentation/Pages` project, `ToPropertyVerification` on net8.0 to net11.0,
  `PlatformBindingsVerification -- --verify` on net10.0, and a native AOT publish of `setup/aot` that reports no
  trim or AOT warnings and runs.
- **Windows** (a real Windows machine or VM): `ToPropertyVerification` on net462 to net481 and net8.0 to net11.0,
  `PlatformBindingsVerification -- --verify` and `threading` on net10.0-windows10.0.19041.0.
- Apple targets are exempt when no Apple host is available.

A behaviour change that users can see gets an example. The website quotes example methods word for word, so a
changed example is updated on the website in the same series of pull requests.

### Pull requests

- **Use the organisation template**, [`reactiveui/.github`
  `PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md`](https://github.com/reactiveui/.github/blob/main/.github/PULL_REQUEST_TEMPLATE.md),
  and fill every section. "How this was verified" never lists test counts, test names or pass results.
- **Title the change by what the code now does**, in Conventional Commits form, e.g. `fix: generate
  BindInteraction calls that start at a field`. Never title it by history, e.g. "add missed tests" or "cover
  lines #126 left".
- **Merge only when every check is green**, including codecov/patch, codecov/project and the SonarCloud quality
  gate. CodeQL does not block. Do not rely on auto-merge: it waits only for required checks.
- **Cancel the running CI of a pull request before pushing to it again.** A run that the next push replaces
  wastes shared runners.

## Build & Test Commands

This project uses **Microsoft Testing Platform (MTP)** with the **TUnit** testing framework. Test commands differ significantly from traditional VSTest.

See: https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/dotnet/core/tools/dotnet-test?tabs=dotnet-test-with-mtp

### Prerequisites

```powershell
# Check .NET installation (.NET 10.0 and 11.0 for tests and benchmarks)
dotnet --info

# Restore NuGet packages
cd src
dotnet restore ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx
```

**Note:** This project uses the modern `.slnx` (XML-based solution file) format instead of the legacy `.sln` format.

### Build Commands

**CRITICAL:** The working folder must be `./src` folder. These commands won't function properly without the correct working folder.

```powershell
# Build the solution
dotnet build ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release

# Build with warnings as errors (includes StyleSharp violations)
dotnet build ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release -warnaserror

# Clean the solution
dotnet clean ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx
```

### Test Commands (Microsoft Testing Platform)

**CRITICAL:** This repository uses MTP configured in `testconfig.json`. All TUnit-specific arguments must be passed after `--`:

The working folder must be `./src` folder.

**IMPORTANT:**
- Do NOT use `--no-build` flag when running tests. Always build before testing to ensure all code changes are compiled.
- Use `--output Detailed` to see Console.WriteLine output from tests (place BEFORE any `--` separator).

```powershell
# Run all tests in the solution
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release

# Run all tests in a specific project
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -c Release
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.Tests.csproj -c Release

# Run a single test method using treenode-filter
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/*/MyTestMethod"

# Run all tests in a specific class
dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests.csproj -- --treenode-filter "/*/*/WhenChangedGeneratorTests/*"

# Run tests with code coverage
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -- --coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura
```

### TUnit Treenode-Filter Syntax

The `--treenode-filter` follows the pattern: `/{AssemblyName}/{Namespace}/{ClassName}/{TestMethodName}`

- Single test: `--treenode-filter "/*/*/*/MyTestMethod"`
- All tests in class: `--treenode-filter "/*/*/MyClassName/*"`
- Use single asterisks (`*`) to match segments.

### Key Configuration Files

- `src/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx` - Modern XML-based solution file
- `src/testconfig.json` - Configures test execution and code coverage
- `src/Directory.Build.props` - Common build properties, package metadata
- `src/Directory.Packages.props` - Central package management
- `src/Directory.Build.targets` - Build targets

### Snapshot Testing

- Generator tests compare every generated file with a `*.verified.cs` snapshot beside the test class, through `Helpers/GeneratorSnapshot.cs`
- A snapshot is named `{type}.{method}#{hint name}.verified.cs`; an output that differs or has no snapshot is written beside it as `*.received.cs` and fails the test, as does a snapshot the run no longer produces
- To accept new or changed snapshots, run the tests with the `ACCEPT_SNAPSHOTS=1` environment variable, then run them again without it

### Generator Test Language Versions (Critical)

Generator tests use a **two-tier language version** strategy to verify generated output compiles under C# 7.3 (the minimum supported version for consumer projects):

- **Default: C# 7.3** — `TestHelper.CreateCompilation()` and `RunGenerator()` default to `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3`. This ensures generated output contains no C# 8+ syntax (no nullable reference type annotations, no `static` lambdas, no `#nullable enable`).
- **CallerArgumentExpression tests: explicit C# 10** — Tests that verify `CallerArgumentExpression`-based dispatch (the primary dispatch mechanism for C# 10+ projects) must pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10` explicitly. These are the majority of snapshot tests.
- **CallerFilePath fallback tests: explicit C# 7.3** — Tests that verify `CallerFilePath + CallerLineNumber` dispatch (the fallback for pre-C# 10 projects) pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3` explicitly to document intent, even though it matches the default.
- **Edge case tests** (`RunGenerator` without snapshot verification) — These use the C# 7.3 default. They verify the generator doesn't crash on invalid lambdas and produces no dispatch code. They don't call `CompilationSucceeds()` since their test source may contain C# 8+ features that are only diagnostically invalid under C# 7.3.
- **Runtime execution tests** — These use `LanguageVersion.CSharp10` because their inline source uses C# 8+ features and they call `CompilationSucceeds()`.

**When adding new generator tests:**
1. If the test verifies CallerArgumentExpression dispatch → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10`
2. If the test verifies CallerFilePath fallback dispatch → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp7_3`
3. If the test verifies the generator skips invalid input → use the default (no parameter)
4. If the test compiles and loads the generated assembly → pass `LanguageVersion.CSharp10`

### Code Coverage

Code coverage uses **Microsoft.Testing.Extensions.CodeCoverage** configured in `src/testconfig.json`. Coverage is collected for production assemblies only (test projects and TestModels are excluded).

```powershell
# Run tests with code coverage (from src/ folder)
dotnet test --solution ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.slnx -c Release -- --coverage --coverage-output-format cobertura

# Generate HTML report using ReportGenerator (install if needed: dotnet tool install -g dotnet-reportgenerator-globaltool)
# Find all cobertura files and generate report to /tmp/<folder>
reportgenerator \
  -reports:"tests/**/TestResults/**/*.cobertura.xml" \
  -targetdir:/tmp/code_coverage \
  -reporttypes:"Html;TextSummary"

# View the text summary
cat /tmp/code_coverage/Summary.txt

# Open HTML report in browser
xdg-open /tmp/code_coverage/index.html   # Linux
open /tmp/code_coverage/index.html        # macOS
```

**Key configuration** (`src/testconfig.json`):
- `modulePaths.include`: `ReactiveUI\\.Binding\\..*` — covers all production assemblies
- `modulePaths.exclude`: `.*Tests.*`, `.*TestRunner.*`, `.*TestModels.*` — excludes test/runner/model assemblies
- `skipAutoProperties: true` — auto-properties excluded from coverage metrics

**Tips:**
- Always clean `bin/` and `obj/` folders before coverage runs to avoid stale results
- The `ReactiveUI.Binding.GeneratedCode.TestModels` assembly has `[assembly: ExcludeFromCodeCoverage]` so it won't appear in reports even though its module path matches the include pattern
- `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` carries the same attribute (applied via `<AssemblyAttribute>` in its .csproj). It is a recompilation of `ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared`, so every line in it is a line `ReactiveUI.Binding` already covers — only the scheduler binding and the namespace differ. Cover shared code through the lean leaf; the `modulePaths` exclusions do not reach an assembly that is only present as a copied reference
- `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` coverage appears as 0% in `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators` — this is a linked-file artifact; the code is actually tested via the `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer` assembly
- Put coverage reports in `/tmp/` to avoid accidentally committing them

## Architecture Overview

### What This Project Does

ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators is an **incremental source generator** that replaces ReactiveUI's runtime expression tree analysis with compile-time code generation for property observation and binding. It eliminates runtime reflection, is fully AOT/trimming safe, and supports all ReactiveUI platform notification mechanisms.

### Generation Pipelines

**Property metadata** is captured while each invocation's property path is extracted. Each link records its
concrete owner, eligible native mechanisms, their scores, and members verified from Roslyn symbols. The same
extraction handles source and referenced types. Selection emits the binding directly.

Observation, command and conversion mechanisms implement their interfaces directly. They use no plugin base
classes. Shared logic lives in static helpers with internal methods. Each mechanism owns its eligibility and
emission; registries compare affinity and retain declaration order on ties.

The native after-change mechanisms (WinForms, WinUI, Uno, Android, UIKit and AppKit) answer the registry the
same way, so one sealed `NativeObservationPlugin` implements the interface for all of them. Each platform is a
static class, such as `WinFormsObservation`. It supplies its kind and affinity, its `Inspect` method, which
decides eligibility, and the statements that attach to its notification. It exposes the result as `Plugin`.

Affinity values match the corresponding ReactiveUI mechanisms, including property-specific UIKit scores of 30,
Apple value notifications at 20, KVO at 15, and ordinary CLR fallback at 1. Registered providers and generated
mechanisms rank on the same scale.

### Mechanisms Travel With the Property Path

A type advertises a mechanism; a *property* participates in it or does not, and each link of a chain is declared
by its own type. So `PropertyPathSegment` carries its declaring type's `ClassBindingInfo`, and plugin selection
takes the property name: a dependency object's plain CLR property and a component's property with no
`{Name}Changed` event fall through to the next mechanism, exactly as a zero affinity does at runtime. A property
the type does not declare - an inherited one - is unknown rather than absent and stays observable.

The mechanism is captured during extraction, which already holds the property symbol, rather than looked up from
the detected-type set afterwards. That is a performance constraint, not a preference: binding one of these
invocations is the single largest allocation in a generation pass (extension-method overload resolution and
generic type inference dominate the `GcVerbose` trace), so a second semantic pass over the same call sites is
not affordable. A type from a *referenced* assembly follows the same extraction path as a source type.

**Pipeline B (Invocation Detection)** scans calls to 14 APIs: `WhenChanged`, `WhenChanging`, `WhenAnyValue`,
`WhenAny`, `WhenAnyObservable`, `BindOneWay`, `BindTwoWay`, `OneWayBind`, `Bind`, `BindTo`, `BindCommand`,
`BindInteraction`, `InvokeCommand` and `ToProperty`. It reads the property paths from each call's lambdas. It writes one method
per call site. [API Pattern](#api-pattern) shows how a call site reaches that method.

**Pipeline C (View Dispatch)** scans classes that implement `IViewFor<T>`. For each view it records:

- the view model type and the view type
- whether the view has a parameterless constructor
- its `[ViewContract]` contract and its `[SingleInstanceView]` flag

It writes `ViewDispatch.g.cs`, a type switch from view model to view. A view with the requested contract comes
before the default view. The default view answers only an empty contract, so a contract no view claims returns
null from the lookup. Each view's resolver tries the service locator first. It then uses the cached instance
for a `[SingleInstanceView]` view, or calls the parameterless constructor. A view with no parameterless
constructor resolves to null. `[ExcludeFromViewRegistration]` leaves a view out.

A view is skipped when it, or a type it is nested in, is an open generic. A closed subclass of a generic view
base registers through its own `IViewFor<T>` interface.

Both runtime flavours are matched: `ReactiveUI.Binding.IViewFor<T>` and `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.IViewFor<T>`.
The view attributes are read from the flavour of the interface the view implements.

ReactiveUI.SourceGenerators' `[IViewFor<T>]` and `[IViewFor("TypeName")]` also register a view. That generator adds
`IViewFor<T>` to the class in output no other generator can see, so the attributes are matched by metadata name through
`ForAttributeWithMetadataName`. The type name is bound at the class's position, so usings, `nameof` and generic names
resolve. The resolver casts the view through `object` with `as`, because the class may not implement the interface. A
view found both ways registers once. A `RegistrationType` of `LazySingleton` or `Constant` is a `[SingleInstanceView]`.

The generated class registers the lookup with `DefaultViewLocator.SetGeneratedViewDispatch`. From C# 9 it does
so in a module initializer, which runs before any code in the assembly. The generator declares
`ModuleInitializerAttribute` when the framework has none. Older projects register in a static constructor, which
runs when a binding first uses the generated class.

Each assembly that contains views registers its own lookup, and `DefaultViewLocator` keeps all of them in
registration order. `ResolveView` asks them from the most recently registered to the first and takes the first
view returned. A view model that two assemblies both have a view for resolves to the assembly that registered
last. Registering the same lookup twice has no effect.

`DefaultViewLocator.ResolveView` tries the generated lookups first. It then tries mappings added with `Map`, and
then the service locator.

### API Pattern

The runtime library declares every API as a stub. The stubs live in `ReactiveUIBindingExtensions` and
`ReactiveSchedulerExtensions`. A stub throws `InvalidOperationException` when it runs. Its message names the
`Unsafe` overload.

For each call site, the generator writes a method that does the work. The call site reaches that method in one of
two ways.

- **An interceptor.** On Roslyn 4.13 and newer, the generator emits an `[InterceptsLocation]` method. The compiler
  replaces the call with it. Setting `ReactiveUIBindingUseInterceptors` to `false` turns this off.
- **A concrete overload.** Otherwise the generator emits an overload that beats the generic stub in method lookup.
  From C# 10 it matches the call site by the lambda's text, captured with `[CallerArgumentExpression]`. Below
  C# 10 it matches by `[CallerFilePath]` and `[CallerLineNumber]`.

A call site the generator cannot read has to use the `Unsafe` overload. That overload finds properties by
reflection.

```csharp
// User writes:
var obs = vm.WhenChanged(x => x.Name);

// The runtime stub, which throws when nothing replaces the call:
public static IObservable<TReturn> WhenChanged<TObj, TReturn>(this TObj obj, Expression<Func<TObj, TReturn>> property, ...)

// The generator writes one method per call site:
private static IObservable<string> __WhenChanged_7FFFD2E8D6FC818E(MyViewModel obj)
{
    // Attaches to PropertyChanged and emits the current value first.
}

// Roslyn 4.13 and newer: an interceptor claims the call site.
[InterceptsLocation(1, "...")]
internal static IObservable<string> __Intercept_WhenChanged_7FFFD2E8D6FC818E(this MyViewModel obj, Expression<Func<MyViewModel, string>> property, ...)
    => __WhenChanged_7FFFD2E8D6FC818E(obj);

// Roslyn 4.8 to 4.12: a concrete overload wins lookup and matches the call site.
public static IObservable<string> WhenChanged(this MyViewModel obj, Expression<Func<MyViewModel, string>> property, [CallerArgumentExpression("property")] string propertyExpression = "", ...)
{
    if (propertyExpression == "x => x.Name")
    {
        return __WhenChanged_7FFFD2E8D6FC818E(obj);
    }

    throw new InvalidOperationException("No generated binding found. ...");
}
```

**File-and-line dispatch matches what the compiler passes.** Two rules keep the condition in step with the
compiler:

- `CallerFilePath` holds the path as the compiler saw it: backslashes on Windows, and possibly mixed separators
  after a path map. The generator keys on the file's last two segments, and
  `CodeGeneratorHelpers.AppendCallerFilePathTest` tests them with a forward slash and with a backslash. Every
  file-and-line condition goes through that helper.
- `CallerLineNumber` holds the line of the invoked member's name, not the line the invocation starts on. A chained
  call written across lines starts at its receiver, several lines up. Every extractor reads the line through
  `SyntaxHelpers.CallerLineNumber`, which follows the compiler's rule.

The generator tests use an empty file path, so snapshots never show the separator test.
`CallerFilePathSeparatorTests` gives the file a Windows path and runs a chained call below C# 10.

### Where the Dispatch Overloads Live

The generated concrete overloads have to beat the runtime stub at the call site, and they have to do it
without two generator-running assemblies seeing each other's copies. Extension-method lookup decides both:
it walks the enclosing namespaces of the call site from the inside out and **stops at the first level that
offers any candidate**, and a namespace brought in by a `using` (file-level or global) is only ever consulted
at the outermost level.

From C# 10 the overloads go in the **consumer's own root namespace** (`build_property.RootNamespace`,
rendered as identifier segments so a project name like `My-App` still yields a legal namespace), plus a
generated `global using` of it. Two routes, two jobs:

- the root namespace catches call sites nested under it, including a consumer whose own code sits under
  `ReactiveUI.Binding.*` — those reach the stub at an enclosing level, so a `global using` alone never gets
  looked at and the call falls through to the stub's runtime throw;
- the `global using` catches files declared outside the root namespace.

Either way the concrete overload lands in the same candidate set as the generic stub and wins outright, because
a non-generic candidate beats a generic one. A `global using` is scoped to the compilation that declares it and
is never exported, which is what keeps one assembly's overloads out of another's lookup — the case that matters
when the two are joined by `InternalsVisibleTo`, since identical overloads visible from both make every matching
call site ambiguous (CS0121). When the build exposes no root namespace, the fallback is
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Generated.<assembly>`.

The residual risk is two assemblies that **share a root namespace**, grant each other `InternalsVisibleTo`, and
both generate a dispatch for the same concrete types — those calls are ambiguous again. All three have to
coincide; a project and its test project have distinct root namespaces and are unaffected.

Below C# 10 there are no global usings, so there is nothing to scope a namespace with. The overloads stay in
`ReactiveUI.Binding`, where the import every consumer already has reaches them from any file — **unless the
assembly grants `InternalsVisibleTo`**, which is the only way another assembly can see them at all. Those
assemblies emit into their own root namespace instead, which nobody else's code sits under. The cost is that a
file declared outside the root namespace falls back to the runtime path; the alternative for those assemblies
is not universal reach but a build that does not compile (CS0121). With no root namespace to move to, the
shared namespace is kept — nowhere else would be reachable.

### Recognising the Class a Stub Was Declared In

Every extractor asks the same question of a call it has matched by name: is the method one of ours? It answers
by the declaring type's name, so the answer has to survive **how the API was declared**.
`ReactiveSchedulerExtensions` declares its whole surface as extension blocks, and an extension block's members
belong to a synthesized grouping type nested inside the static class, not to the class itself. The grouping type
has no name a consumer could write — empty when read from source, `<>E__N` when read from metadata — so
`ExtractorValidation.IsRecognizedExtensionClass` takes the symbol and reaches one level out when it finds one.

**Which of the two shapes a call site resolves to is decided by the Roslyn that loads the generator, not by
anything in the consumer's project.** The same source, the same references and the same `LangVersion` resolve
to the static class on one compiler and to the grouping type on another. Rejecting either shape is silent:
those call sites produce no dispatch, the runtime stub throws, and every other call site in the file still
generates, so the build stays green and only the affected bindings go missing.

There is no single version to code against. The generator is loaded by whatever compiler the consumer's SDK or
Visual Studio ships, and that spans the whole installed base at once - an unchanged project produces one shape
on one machine and the other shape on the next. **Accept every shape rather than the one this repository
happens to build with**, and never narrow a symbol test to what the current compiler returns.

That cuts against the suite, which pins a single `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` package version and so
exercises exactly one of those compilers. Passing tests say the generator works on that one, and say nothing
about the rest. Where behaviour could turn on the host compiler, verify against several: run the generator from
a throwaway single-file app that pins a different `Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.CSharp` version, over a real
project's sources, and compare the emitted files. When a call site generates in the suite but not in a real
build, suspect this first and check a real build's `EmitCompilerGeneratedFiles` output rather than adding
more tests that share the suite's compiler.

### Where This Engine Parts Company With ReactiveUI's

The generator is a replacement for `PropertyBinderImplementation`, so its behaviour is measured against that
engine. Generated bindings and reflection-based bindings have distinct entry points.

**`TriggerUpdate` and `signalViewUpdate` use `BindUnsafe`.** The view-first Unsafe overloads accept a stream
with registered or explicit converters. `ViewToViewModel` replaces view notifications with the stream;
`ViewModelToView` takes the first model notification and uses the stream for subsequent model-to-view updates,
while observing view notifications. A null stream observes both properties. The initial delivery reads from the
model even when later notifications replace a queued direction before its dispatch. Both sides are read at
delivery, compared after conversion, and written through the view-thread scheduler. These calls carry
`RequiresUnreferencedCode`; generated calls resolve from their property lambdas.

**Binding faults follow ReactiveUI's contract exactly.** A write that faults is logged against the bound
expression, and rethrown as a `TargetInvocationException` only when it carries an inner exception. This is
parity rather than divergence, and it is not optional: a setter that throws on the notifying thread has no
caller stack to surface on, so swallowing it loses the failure entirely.

**Hooks are consulted only when one is registered.** ReactiveUI asks the service locator for
`IPropertyBindingHook` on every binding it creates. `BindingHooks.Any` is tested first here, so an
application that registers none - which is nearly all of them - pays nothing, and one that registers a hook
gets the same veto. That is the "better" half of the divergence: same outcome, no cost for the common case.

**A registered plugin still outranks the generated observation.** The generator picks a mechanism from the
types it can see at compile time, but `ICreatesObservableForProperty` is registered at run time and the
highest affinity wins - which is how ReactiveUI resolves the observation behind `Bind` and `OneWayBind`, not
just behind `WhenChanged`. The choice is made per observed link rather than per binding:
`ObservationAffinityChecker.FindHigherAffinityPlugin` is asked for a registration outranking the affinity
that link was generated from, and the link observes through `PluginPropertyObservable` when one wins and
through the generated mechanism when none does. A two-way binding observes both sides, so either side's
registration takes that side.

**The registration drives the observation without an expression engine.** `PluginPropertyObservable`
subscribes to the registration for *when* the property changed and reads the value through the accessor the
generator emitted, so the honouring of a plugin costs no reflection. Everything the plugin needs is fixed at
compile time - the declaring type, the property name, the getter, and a lambda the compiler turns into member
tokens - which is what keeps a consumer publishing ahead-of-time free of trim and AOT warnings. Nothing on a
generated path reaches the runtime expression engine; routing a whole binding to it instead would put
`[RequiresUnreferencedCode]` back on every call site.

The registered set and strongest custom vote are cached by runtime type, property and notification timing.
Each binding compares that vote with its generated score; the generated mechanism wins ties. `Refresh()`
replaces the cache generation, so an in-flight lookup cannot repopulate it with stale registrations. Generated
expressions and object adapters for a custom provider are constructed only when that provider wins.

**Every binding writes on the view's owning thread.** ReactiveUI moves a write only on WPF. It does so for a
two-way `Bind` and for swapping a control's `Command`. Here every binding API moves it, on WPF, WinForms and MAUI.
The order matches ReactiveUI's WPF binder, which checks `CheckAccess()` before it uses
`RxSchedulers.MainThreadScheduler`. A ReactiveUI adapter sets `BindingSchedulers.MainThread` to that scheduler to
get the same result.

### Which Thread a Binding Writes On

A UI framework lets only one thread touch a view. That is the view's owning thread. Every binding API sends its
view writes through `BindingSchedulers.ObserveOnViewThread`. Generated and `Unsafe` calls both do. The observation
APIs (`WhenChanged`, `WhenAny`, `WhenAnyValue` and the rest) do not. The caller decides where to observe.

**`IViewThreadInvoker` is the contract.** It has three members.

- `Claims(target)` says whether the object belongs to this platform.
- `CheckAccess(target)` says whether the calling thread may write to the object now.
- `Post(target, callback, state)` queues the callback on the owning thread.

Each platform module registers one invoker. Each invoker uses its platform's own API.

| Invoker | `CheckAccess` | `Post` |
|---------|---------------|--------|
| WPF `DispatcherViewThreadInvoker` | `DispatcherObject.CheckAccess()` | `Dispatcher.BeginInvoke`; inline with no dispatcher, as for a frozen `Freezable` |
| WinForms `ControlViewThreadInvoker` | `!Control.InvokeRequired` | `Control.BeginInvoke`; inline while the control has no handle |
| MAUI `DispatcherViewThreadInvoker` | `!IDispatcher.IsDispatchRequired` | `IDispatcher.Dispatch`; inline with no dispatcher |

MAUI's `BindableObject.Dispatcher` throws `InvalidOperationException` when it finds no dispatcher. That is normal in
a view's unit test. The MAUI invoker catches it. It treats the object as having no owning thread.

**`ViewThreadObservable` decides every route.** Invokers only answer its questions.

1. It uses the first registered invoker that claims the target. A generated binding also passes a fallback: an
   invoker to use when no registered one claims the target. With no invoker at all, the source comes back
   unchanged.
2. A notification runs inline when nothing is waiting and `CheckAccess` passes.
3. Any other notification waits. One drain delivers what waits. It runs on `BindingSchedulers.MainThread` when that
   is set, and through `Post` otherwise.

Only the latest value waits. A newer value replaces it, even one raised on the owning thread while a drain runs.
Completion and errors wait beside the value and are delivered after it.

Keeping every value breaks two-way bindings. Writing a view raises the view's own change at once. If a newer value
is still waiting, that echo writes the older value back to the view model. The write raises another change, and
the two sides bounce forever. `ViewWriteSchedulingRuntimeTests` covers this for `Bind` and `BindTwoWay`.

A two-way binding that names a sequencer follows the same rule. An `Unsafe` binding routes the source direction
through `ViewThreadObservable` on that sequencer, so only the latest value waits on it. A generated binding routes
both directions through `BindingSchedulers.ObserveOnSequencer`, which is the same stage. A value that a newer one
supersedes before the sequencer runs is never written, so two edits before the queue drains write once, with the
second. A null scheduler and the immediate sequencer skip the stage: the first writes on the thread that owns the
target and the second writes inline.

`MainThread` only carries writes from another thread to a claimed object. It never sees an on-thread write. It
never sees a write to an unclaimed object.

**Generated bindings carry their fallback.** They route writes without the platform module.

- `ViewThreadPluginRegistry` checks the target's type during extraction. It matches
  `System.Windows.Threading.DispatcherObject`, `System.Windows.Forms.Control` and
  `Microsoft.Maui.Controls.BindableObject`.
- The invocation model stores the matching runtime invoker's full name. `BindTo`, `BindOneWay`, `OneWayBind` and
  `Bind` store it for the target. `BindTwoWay` stores it for both sides. `BindCommand` stores it for the view, and
  for the control when the view has none.
- The emitter passes the platform package's invoker, such as
  `global::ReactiveUI.Binding.Wpf.DispatcherViewThreadInvoker.Instance`, in the flavour the compilation references.
- An invoker is named only when its type resolves. Without the platform package the binding carries none, and
  RXUIBIND017 reports the binding.

The generator never declares an invoker itself: the invokers are public types in the platform packages.

An `Unsafe` binding only has the registered invokers. It routes writes only when the platform module is registered.

There is no WinUI invoker. No runtime package registers one. A generated one would route writes that the `Unsafe`
twin does not.

### Operators Come From Primitives

`ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared/Observables/` holds only the observables this library's *domain* owns - the ones
that turn a property notification into an `IObservedChange`. Anything that is a general reactive operator
belongs to `ReactiveUI.Primitives`, which is already referenced, and is used from there rather than
hand-rolled again here.

Primitives exposes both a concrete type per operator under `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Advanced` and a factory or
extension that returns it. **Prefer the concrete type** - `new LeadSignal<T>(source, value)` over
`source.StartWith(value)` - so the generated and runtime code says exactly what it builds. Reach for the
factory only where it is the better path: `Signal.Never<T>()`, `Signal.Empty<T>()` and `Signal.Return<T>(v)`
hand back cached singletons or a specialised immediate form that the public constructors cannot express.

Two traps when naming these:

- **`ReactiveUI.Primitives.Core` does not shift.** It is one assembly shared by both runtime flavours rather
  than one recompiled per leaf, so the types in it - `ImmutableNeverSignal<T>`, `ImmediateReturnSignal<T>` -
  stay in `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Advanced` for the `.Reactive` leaf too. That leaf imports the unshifted
  namespace alongside its shifted one; the two declare disjoint types, which is what lets the lean leaf merge
  them already.
- **Generated code qualifies operator types**, such as `global::ReactiveUI.Primitives.Advanced.WitnessOnSignal<T>`,
  so `RuntimeFlavourRewriter` can retarget the types declared by the `.Reactive` flavour. Immediate scheduling
  returns the source directly. The shared `MapSignal` type keeps its namespace.

Use `CurrentValueDelivery<T>` for after-change and custom-provider reads and `SerializedDelivery<T>` with
reentrancy enabled for before-change capture. Keep each gate in a mutable field. Read after-change values inside
the gate; capture before-change values on the raising thread. Attach before initial delivery and release the
subscription if initialization throws. A contended producer can hand off after the gate's 20 ms wait budget.
Custom-provider terminals must follow a change raised inside the current observer call.

Two-source combinations construct `CombineLatestSignal<TLeft, TRight, TResult>`. For 3–16 sources, keep the
`CombineLatest` extension's specialized subscription path. Keep the specialized `Return`, `Never`, and `Empty`
factories, the internal `Skip` operator's extension, and the subscription extensions' fast paths.

What stays in `Observables/` is decided by whether the type is a general operator or something this domain
fuses:

| Type | Why it lives here |
|------|-------------------|
| `PropertyObservable`, `NotifyPropertyChangedObservable`, `PropertyChangingObservable` | Turn a property notification into an `IObservedChange`. The concept is this library's, so no general-purpose equivalent exists. |
| `EventObservable` | Fuses add/remove handler, the getter, `StartWith` and `DistinctUntilChanged` into **one** allocation. Assembling the same behaviour from `Signal.FromEventPattern` and three operators costs four. |
| `CombineLatestObservable` | A façade over `LinqExtensions.CombineLatest` that builds nothing itself, so every call site names one thing. |

**A fused type is not replaced by a chain of general operators.** The point of this library is the allocation
count, so a swap that trades one object for four is a regression however much code it removes. Measure before
assuming a replacement is free.

### ToProperty and the Helper Behind It

`ToProperty` backs a read-only property with an observable. The generated worker calls
`ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>.Create`, passing the owning object and two lambdas that take it as an argument.
The lambdas capture nothing, so the compiler caches each as one static delegate. The property name is a literal.

**How the generator raises the owner's notifications.** A type can only raise its own events. The
`PropertyRaise` plugins each name a member generated code can reach, strongest first, and the first that applies
wins:

| Plugin | Applies when | Generated call |
|--------|--------------|----------------|
| `ReactiveObjectRaisePlugin` (10) | The type implements `ReactiveUI.IReactiveObject` | `IReactiveObjectExtensions.RaisePropertyChanged(owner, "Name")` |
| `RaiseMethodRaisePlugin` (5) | A raise method is accessible from the consumer assembly | `owner.RaisePropertyChanged(args)` |
| `PartialTypeRaisePlugin` (1) | The type and every type around it are partial | `owner.__ToPropertyRaiseChanged_Name()`, an accessor added to the type |

- The ReactiveUI plugin goes through the public extension, not `IReactiveObject.RaisePropertyChanged(args)`. Only
  the extension honours suppressed and delayed notifications and feeds `Changed`. The extension class is taken
  from the assembly that declares the object's ReactiveUI base, because each flavour keeps its own state.
- A raise method that takes event args wins over one that takes a name. Generated code passes one static
  `PropertyChangedEventArgs` per property, so raising allocates nothing.
- The partial accessor is an `internal` member on the consumer's own type. It is the only code the generator adds
  to a consumer type for `ToProperty`. It declares no type, so `InternalsVisibleTo` friends see no duplicate.
- The plugins are symbol-only, so `ToPropertyAnalyzer` links them and reports RXUIBIND012 exactly when the
  generator declines a call.

**The selector is a `Func`, not an expression tree.** The generated code never reads the selector. It only needs
the property name, which the generator reads from the lambda's syntax. A non-capturing lambda converted to a
delegate is a compiler-cached static, so a call allocates nothing for it. A lambda converts to `Func` and to
`Expression<Func>` with equal rank, so the generated concrete overload still beats the generic stub.

**A string name is dispatched by its value.** The overloads that take the property name as a `string` have no
caller-information parameters. The generated overload compares the name itself, as in `if (property == "Name")`,
and call sites that pass the same name collapse to one branch. A string name carries everything the body needs, so
the call site does not matter.

**A selector overload with an initial value has priority.** The selector overloads carry
`[CallerArgumentExpression]` string parameters. For a `string` property, a string initial value could bind to the
initial-value overload or to the expression parameter of the overload without one, and the call is ambiguous
(CS0121). The initial-value overloads carry `[OverloadResolutionPriority(1)]` to settle it. The runtime declares an
internal copy of the attribute below .NET 9. Generated overloads carry it when `LanguageFeatures.SupportsOverloadResolutionPriority`
is set: C# 13 or later, and the attribute is accessible. Below C# 13 the compiler ignores the attribute, so such a
call names its argument: `initialValue: "..."`.

RXUIBIND014 turns that ambiguity into an error that names the argument to write. `ToPropertyInitialValueAnalyzer`
reads the language version and the method name from syntax, so it asks the model only about `ToProperty` calls
below C# 13. The compiler reports CS0121 as an overload resolution failure with the candidates attached. The
analyzer reports when one candidate takes a positional argument as `initialValue` and another takes it as an
optional `string` parameter.

**`ToPropertyUnsafe` finds the raise member by reflection.** It mirrors every `ToProperty` shape, with an
`Expression` selector or any string name, and carries `[RequiresUnreferencedCode]` and `[RequiresDynamicCode]`.
`RuntimePropertyRaiser` tries the members the plugins try, in the same order: ReactiveUI's raise extensions, then a
raise method, then the field behind a field-like event. Reflection reaches a protected or private raise method and
a non-partial type's event field, which generated code cannot; SES1406 is suppressed on those two lookups.

The members are cached per type. Each raiser binds a raise method to its owner once, with `CreateDelegate`, which
closes an instance method over its target and a static extension over its first argument. The raiser is the
helper's owner, so the helper's callbacks capture nothing. A raise method that returns a value cannot bind to
`Action<T>`, so it is called through `MethodInfo.Invoke` instead.

**The helper keeps its state in a private core.** `ObservableAsPropertyHelper<T>` is the public face. Its private
nested `Core` holds the state and implements `IObserver<T>`, so the helper exposes no observer that others could
push values through. The source subscribes to the core, so the helper's constructor never hands out `this`.

- The gate is an `int` taken with one `Interlocked.CompareExchange`, so the helper allocates no lock object. Each
  critical section is a few field reads and writes, and no callback runs inside one. A waiter backs off with
  `SpinWait` and never sleeps: on .NET Core it calls `SpinOnce(-1)`, because a one-millisecond sleep outlasts the
  holder's critical section many times over. .NET Framework has no such overload and keeps the default backoff.
- Delivery with no scheduler is serialized. A value produced while another is being delivered, from a callback or
  from another thread, is queued and delivered next by the thread already delivering. The queue is created the
  first time a value has to wait.
- The distinct gate is seeded with the initial value, including after deferred activation, so a source that
  opens by repeating the initial value raises nothing.
- `ThrownExceptions` observers live in a `Broadcaster<Exception>`, which is safe to change from any thread, so
  adding one takes no gate.

**The extractor reads syntax before it asks the model.** Resolving a call runs overload resolution and generic
inference, which is the most expensive thing an extractor does. A selector that is not `x => x.Property` can never
generate, so its syntax turns it away first.

**`[ObservableAsProperty]` only applies to a partial property.** The attribute is a runtime type. The generator
writes the property's body and a `_{name}Helper` field, and the consumer assigns the field with `ToProperty`. The
consumer declares the property, so every generator in the build sees it. A property written from a field would
exist only in generated code, which no other generator can observe or bind, so that form is not offered.

The attribute's `InitialValue`, `ReadOnly` and `UseProtected` shape the generated members. A non-string
`InitialValue` is an expression held in a backing field. The generated file repeats the declaring file's `using` and
`extern alias` directives, so the expression binds as it was written. The attribute is also valid on a field, a method
and a property, the forms of ReactiveUI's older generator, so that code compiles. RXUIBIND018 reports them, and
`ObservableAsPropertyCodeFixProvider` rewrites them as partial properties; `PropertyName` and `Inheritance` exist only
for that rewrite.

### One Body Per Reachable Branch

The two dispatch mechanisms differ in what they can tell apart, and the emitted bodies follow. File-and-line
dispatch keys on the call site, so every call site is distinct and each needs its own binding method.
Expression-text dispatch keys on the two lambdas as written, so call sites that spell them the same way all
produce the same condition — the first wins, and any later one is unreachable while still dragging a binding
method along. Binding the same pair of properties from more than one place is ordinary rather than exotic, so
that dead weight scales with the consumer.

`BindingEmitterHelpers.Generate` therefore collapses a group to one call site per distinct pair of expression
texts, but **only under expression-text dispatch**. Collapsing is sound there because the group already fixes
both types, so a shared pair of expressions means a shared pair of property paths and an identical body. Doing
the same under file-and-line dispatch would strand every collapsed call site on the stub's runtime throw.

Collapsing is sound only while the lambdas are everything that shapes the body. Any other argument that changes
the body belongs in both the branch condition and the collapse key. `BindCommand` is the example: an explicit
`toEvent` replaces the mechanism the control would bind through, and a `withParameter` selector picks the
property that feeds the control. So its branch compares `toEvent` and the parameter text as well as the two
selectors. A call site that names no event carries no `toEvent` condition, so the call sites that name one are
tried first. An argument that changes the overload's signature belongs in the group key instead: a converter, a
hint, a scheduler, or the type an observable handler produces each get their own overload.

The dispatch compares the text exactly as the compiler captured it, so a `static` lambda and the same lambda
without the modifier are two call sites with two branches. Nothing strips the modifier at run time.

### Generating for the Lean or the .Reactive Runtime

The two runtime packages share **no type names** — everything the lean one puts in `ReactiveUI.Binding.*`, the
other puts in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.*`, and the scheduler abstraction differs outright
(`ISequencer` vs `IScheduler`). Output written for one does not compile against the other at all, so the
generator branches on which package the consumer actually references, detected by looking up the stub class.

The emitters write the lean names throughout, and `RuntimeFlavourRewriter` retargets the finished text when the
consumer is on the System.Reactive package. It runs on the finished text rather than being threaded through the
emitters because most generated bodies are **non-interpolated** raw string literals whose braces are the braces
of the generated code — making them interpolated to inject a namespace would mean escaping every one.

The shift is anchored on the names the runtime namespace actually declares, read from the referenced assembly
rather than listed in the generator. That way it cannot go stale as the runtime grows, and it will not touch a
consumer type that merely happens to sit under `ReactiveUI.Binding` — which is exactly what a consumer whose own
root namespace starts that way would otherwise hit.

Every generated file goes out through `CodeGeneratorHelpers.AddGeneratedSource` so no emitter can forget the
retargeting. Forgetting would only ever show up as generated code that does not compile, for consumers of the
package the test suite reaches least. `ReactiveRuntimeFlavourTests` sweeps **every** shared scenario against the
System.Reactive package for that reason — one unshifted type name in one emitter is enough to break every
consumer on it, and no representative subset can be trusted to reach it.

### Matching the Stub's Parameter List

The concrete overload only beats the generic stub once their parameter lists match — a non-generic candidate is
preferred over a generic one, but that tie-break needs the two to be otherwise indistinguishable. A shorter
parameter list leaves both merely applicable, neither better, and **every matching call site fails with CS0121**.

Every stub declares its `[CallerArgumentExpression]` parameters on every target framework. Below .NET 5 the
attribute comes from the runtime library's `internal` polyfill in `Polyfills/`. The stub files carry no
`#if` around those parameters, so each overload is written once.

Declaring a parameter does not mean the compiler fills it. The compiler fills the parameter on the generated
overload only when two things hold:

- The consumer compiles at C# 10 or later.
- The generated overload can apply the attribute, because exactly one accessible attribute type resolves in the
  consumer's compilation. On .NET Framework the only copy is the runtime's `internal` one, which the consumer
  cannot apply.

`LanguageFeatures` carries the two answers separately:

- `StubHasExpressionParameters` reads the referenced stub's own parameter list. It decides whether the generated
  overload declares the parameters, so the two lists match. A runtime package built before the parameters
  existed on every framework reads as `false`.
- `SupportsCallerArgExpr` is the above, C# 10, and an accessible attribute. It decides whether the parameters
  carry the attribute and whether dispatch matches on expression text rather than on `CallerFilePath` +
  `CallerLineNumber`.

When the compiler will not fill the parameters, the generated overload declares them unattributed. They exist
only so the lists line up, and dispatch runs off the file and line. The generator never declares the attribute
itself. Another generator, such as PolySharp, can declare it in the same compilation, and two declarations do not
compile (CS0101). `LanguageFeatureDetectionTests` covers a .NET Framework consumer and one on a framework that
declares the attribute.

The overloads that take an `IBindingTypeConverter` - `BindOneWay`, `BindTwoWay`, `OneWayBind` and `Bind` with a
converter, an optional hint and an optional scheduler - declare no expression parameters at all. Their call sites
are dispatched by file and line at every language version and are never collapsed. Their generated overload keeps
the stub's parameter names, so a call that names an argument still resolves to it. The scheduler is optional, so
a call that leaves it out reaches the binding as null.

Every property-binding overload that takes a scheduler treats null the same way: the binding writes on the thread
that owns the target, as if no scheduler had been named. The generated binding tests for null once, when it is
created.

A generated overload also declares nullable reference types the way the stub does. The property selectors, the
scheduler, and the view model or target the stub takes as `TViewModel?` or `TTarget?`, are annotated `?` wherever
the target supports nullable reference types, so a call that passes an explicit null scheduler compiles without a
warning. Value types are left alone, because annotating one adds a conversion node to
the expression and breaks path extraction.

### WhenChanged vs WhenChanging

| API | Interface | Event | Timing |
|-----|-----------|-------|--------|
| `WhenChanged` | `INotifyPropertyChanged` | `PropertyChanged` | After value changes |
| `WhenChanging` | `INotifyPropertyChanging` | `PropertyChanging` | Before value changes |

Not all platforms support before-change notifications (WPF DP, WinUI DP, WinForms, Android do not). The analyzer reports RXUIBIND004 when `WhenChanging` targets an unsupported platform type.

## Code Style & Quality Requirements

**CRITICAL:** All code must comply with ReactiveUI contribution guidelines: https://www.reactiveui.net/contribute/index.html

### Style Enforcement

- EditorConfig rules (`.editorconfig`), kept in step with the RoslynCommonAnalyzers repository's own `.editorconfig`
- StyleSharp, PerformanceSharp and SecuritySharp analyzers - builds fail on violations
- The Sonar rules are set to `none`, so the SonarCloud scan does not report what these analyzers already cover
- **All public APIs require XML documentation comments**
- **Public API baselines**: every shipping library checks in `PublicAPI/<tfm>/PublicAPI.txt` through PublicApiSharp.Analyzers (PAS0001-PAS0005 are errors); generators, analyzers, tests and benchmarks are not tracked. To regenerate one, empty the file and run `dotnet format analyzers <project> -f <tfm> --diagnostics PAS0001 PAS0003 --severity info`
- **RS2008**: Analyzer release tracking enabled (`AnalyzerReleases.Shipped.md` / `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md`)

### C# Style Rules

- **Braces:** Allman style
- **Indentation:** 4 spaces, no tabs
- **Fields:** `_camelCase` for private/internal
- **Visibility:** Always explicit, visibility first modifier
- **Namespaces:** File-scoped preferred
- **Modern C#:** Nullable reference types, pattern matching, records, init setters
- **netstandard2.0 targets:** Use `IsExternalInit.cs` polyfill for records; avoid APIs not available in netstandard2.0 (e.g., use `if (x is null) throw new System.ArgumentNullException(...)` instead of `ArgumentNullException.ThrowIfNull()`)

## Writing Docs

These rules cover README.md, CLAUDE.md and every other doc in the repository. They do not cover XML doc comments.

### Who you write for

Write for a reader at a grade 8 level who knows basic C#. They know what a class, a property and an event are. They do not know this library.

### Sentences

- Put the main point first.
- Give each sentence one subject. Use two only when they are tightly coupled.
- Keep sentences short. Split a sentence that needs a dash, a semicolon or a "which" to hold together.
- Use the active voice. Say who does what: "the binding writes the value", not "the value is written".
- Use verbs, not nouns made from verbs. Write "decide", not "make a decision".
- Say what is true. Avoid double negatives.
- Cut words that add nothing. Do not restate a point in the next sentence.

### Words

- Use everyday words. When you need a technical term, define it the first time you use it.
- Define each term once. After that, use it without explaining it again.
- Use the same word for the same thing every time. Do not swap in a synonym for variety.
- Use "you" for the reader.

### Structure

- Use headings so a reader can find a topic.
- Use a list for steps or for separate items. Use a table to compare items across the same columns.
- Show a short code example when it explains faster than words.

### Scope

- Each section says what this library does, on its own terms.
- Anything that differs from ReactiveUI goes only under the differences header: "Where this differs from ReactiveUI" in README.md, and "Where This Engine Parts Company With ReactiveUI's" here. Do not compare with ReactiveUI anywhere else.
- Describe the code as it is. Do not describe what it used to do.

## Analyzer Suppression Policy

**NO analyzer suppressions are allowed unless discussed and approved first.** This applies to every form of suppression: `[SuppressMessage]` attributes, `#pragma warning disable`, `.editorconfig` severity downgrades, and `<NoWarn>` in project files. **Fix the underlying issue instead.**

If a rule genuinely cannot be fixed without changing behavior or public API, **STOP and raise it for discussion — do not suppress unilaterally, and do not present a suppression as if it were a fix.**

### Pre-approved suppressions (the ONLY ones allowed without further discussion)

| Rule | Where it may be suppressed | Justification text |
|------|----------------------------|--------------------|
| **SST1472** (too many parameters) | The **offending method only** (never class-level) where the parameter count is inherent — e.g. CombineLatest selector lambdas, CallerInfo dispatch stubs. | parameter count is inherent to the API/overload under test |
| **SST2307** (generic type param not inferable) | **Public / interface-dictated** generic methods whose signature cannot change. Must be **fixed** (refactored) when the method is private/internal and refactorable. | type parameter is dictated by the interface / specified explicitly by the caller |
| **SST1300** (PascalCase naming) | Only for established domain acronyms: **INPC** (INotifyPropertyChanged), **KVO** (Key-Value Observing), **POCO**. | established acronym matching ReactiveUI domain terminology |
| **SST2309** (optional parameters) | Only the CallerInfo dispatch stubs (e.g. `ReactiveSchedulerExtensions`) where converting to overloads would exceed the parameter-count limit (SST1472). | part of the CallerInfo dispatch contract; overloads would exceed the parameter limit |
| **CA1040** (empty interfaces) | Only interfaces that are intentional **marker interfaces** (e.g. `IActivatableView`). | intentional marker interface |
| **SST1711** (extension block member never reads its receiver) | Only the CallerInfo dispatch stubs declared in extension blocks (e.g. `ReactiveSchedulerExtensions`). A genuine member that ignores its receiver moves to a static helper class instead. | part of the CallerInfo dispatch contract; the generated overload reads the receiver and this stub only throws |
| **SES1406** (reflection with `BindingFlags.NonPublic`) | The **offending member only**, in reflection-based runtime code whose job requires reaching a non-public member and has no public route - e.g. `RuntimePropertyRaiser` invoking a protected raise method or a field-like event's backing field. Never where a public member would do, or where ReactiveUI's own lookup is public-only. | reflection-based API that must reach a non-public member; there is no public route |
| **CA1005** (too many generic type parameters) | Only arity-expanded public types whose type parameters are the values they carry (e.g. `PropertyValues<T1..T16>`). | one arity-expanded emission per observed-property count; the type parameters are the observed properties |

Anything **not** in this table — including (non-exhaustively) CA1019, CA1508, SST1175, SST1473, SST2337 — must be **fixed**, or **discussed and approved before any suppression is added**.

## Key Architectural Patterns

### Value-Equatable Models (Critical for Caching)

All pipeline models are `sealed record` types with value equality. NEVER include `ISymbol`, `SyntaxNode`, or `Location` in pipeline outputs. Use `EquatableArray<T>` for array equality. Extract strings from symbols using `ToDisplayString(SymbolDisplayFormat.FullyQualifiedFormat)`.

### Code Generation Strategy

- Emitters write through `SourceWriter`, not `SyntaxFactory` and not a raw `StringBuilder`
- Generated code emitted as C# source via `context.AddSource()`
- `#pragma warning disable` at top of generated files
- All generated types use `[Microsoft.CodeAnalysis.Embedded]` attribute

### Writing Generated Code

`SourceWriter` owns the layout of every generated file. An emitter says what it writes, and the writer decides
the indentation.

- **The writer tracks the level.** A line is indented when its first character is written. A blank line carries
  no whitespace. Every line ends with `\n`. No string literal in an emitter starts with spaces.
- **Blocks change the level.** `OpenBlock` and `CloseBlock` write the braces and move one level in and out.
  `OpenContinuation` moves the rest of a multi-line expression one level deeper.
- **Each emitter method writes at the level it is given.** It leaves the level as it found it, unless its name
  says it opens something, like `OpenParameterList` or `AppendChoiceOpen`. Its doc comment says where it leaves
  the writer.
- **C# constructs have names.** `SourceWriterExtensions` covers the file header, namespaces, types, doc comments,
  attributes, parameter lists, branches, locals, returns and `try`/`finally`. A construct built from several
  values has a `Begin` member that writes the keyword. The emitter appends the parts, and a closing member
  finishes the line, so no intermediate string is built.
- **Domain shapes have names too.** Examples are `CodeGeneratorHelpers.AppendGuardedAssignment`,
  `BindingEmitterHelpers.AppendWriteSubscription`, `ChainRegistrationEmitter.AppendStageOpen` and
  `CommandBindingSyntax.OpenCommandSubscription`. Reuse one before you write the same lines again.
- **Type names live in `GeneratedTypeNames`.** A string literal names a type through a constant hole, such as
  `$"var x = {GeneratedTypeNames.SwapDisposable}();"`. With only constant holes, the compiler folds the string to
  one constant, so this costs nothing at run time.
- **Fixed text is written with `Lines`.** A fixed block, such as the command parameter capture, sits in a raw
  string literal with its indentation relative to column zero. `Lines` indents it from the writer's level.

`SourceWriter.Rent` takes its `StringBuilder` from `PooledBuilder`'s per-thread free list, and
`ToStringAndReturn` gives it back. `PooledStringBuilder` stays the builder for short fragments that are not
lines, such as grouping keys and type argument lists.

`GeneratedLayoutTests` checks every stored snapshot. Each closing brace must line up with its opening brace. A
line inside a block must sit deeper than the block's braces, in whole levels. No line may end in whitespace.

### Generated Code Declares No Shared Types

The generator never emits the same static code into every consumer, and never declares a type whose fully
qualified name another assembly could also declare. An assembly granted `InternalsVisibleTo` would otherwise see two
types by one name.

- Observation helpers are public runtime types: `DeferredPropertyObservable<TSource, TValue>` for a plain property,
  `CallbackPropertyObservable<TSource, TValue>` for every native mechanism (UIKit, AppKit, WinForms, WinUI, Uno,
  Android), and `KvoPropertyObservable<T>` on the core package's Apple heads.
- AppKit command binding installs the runtime's `AppKitCommandTarget`, on the macOS head.
- KVO and AppKit routes are only taken when the runtime type resolves; otherwise the next mechanism wins.
- The `InterceptsLocationAttribute` and `ModuleInitializerAttribute` polyfills are `file`-local to the generated file
  that needs them, so interception and the polyfilled module initializer need C# 11.
- The dispatch class sits in a per-assembly namespace, `ReactiveUI.Binding.Generated.<Assembly>` or
  `ReactiveUI.Binding.Generated.Interceptors.<Assembly>`. Where it has to sit in a namespace other assemblies can
  share (a consumer's root namespace, or the runtime's own below C# 10), its class name carries the assembly:
  `__ReactiveUIGeneratedBindings_<Assembly>`.

### Two-Layer Language Version Constraint

There are **two distinct C# language contexts** in this project:

**Generator source code** (the `.cs` files in `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators/`):
- Compiled with `LangVersion` set to `latest`
- Can freely use raw string literals (`$$"""`), file-scoped namespaces, pattern matching (`is not`), records, switch expressions, etc.
- Must target **netstandard2.0** (Roslyn requirement), but the SDK/language version is latest

**Generated output** (the strings emitted by the generator into user projects):
- Must be **C# 7.3 compatible** — user projects may target older frameworks
- Must follow the **ReactiveUI coding standard** (https://www.reactiveui.net/contribute/index.html) as closely as possible within C# 7.3 constraints
- Key rules for generated output:
  - **Allman-style braces** — each brace on a new line
  - **4-space indentation** — no tabs
  - **Properly formatted multi-line code** — no single-line walls of text for non-trivial expressions
  - **Explicit visibility modifiers** — visibility first (e.g. `private static`, not `static private`)
  - Method bodies indented consistently at 12 spaces (namespace=0, class=4, member=8, body=12)
- C# 7.3 restrictions for generated output — do NOT use:
  - `is not`, `and`, `or` pattern combinators (C# 9)
  - `??=` null-coalescing assignment (C# 8)
  - Switch expressions (C# 8)
  - `required` members (C# 11)
  - Raw string literals (C# 11)
  - File-scoped namespaces (C# 10)
  - `init` setters (C# 9)
- Generated output must NOT use `#nullable enable` or nullable reference type annotations (`T?` where T is a reference type) — these are C# 8+ features
- `static` lambdas are C# 9 — do not use in generated output

### Analyzer Separation (Roslyn Best Practice)

- Generator does NOT report diagnostics
- Separate analyzer project reports all RXUIBIND diagnostics
- `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` and `Constants.cs` are linked from generator to analyzer via `<Compile Include="..." Link="..." />`

### Shared File Linking

The analyzer project links shared files from the generator project:
```xml
<Compile Include="..\ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators\DiagnosticWarnings.cs" Link="DiagnosticWarnings.cs" />
<Compile Include="..\ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators\Constants.cs" Link="Constants.cs" />
```

### The Lean / .Reactive Seam

`ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared` holds the whole runtime library and is compiled twice:

| Leaf | Scheduler type | Namespaces |
|------|----------------|------------|
| `ReactiveUI.Binding` | `ReactiveUI.Primitives.Concurrency.ISequencer` | `ReactiveUI.Binding.*` |
| `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` | `System.Reactive.Concurrency.IScheduler` | `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.*` |

`ReactiveShim.props` (imported by `Directory.Build.props`) keys on the `.Reactive` project-name suffix: it
defines `REACTIVE_SHIM` and aliases `ISequencer` onto `IScheduler`. A future platform leaf such as
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Wpf.Reactive` picks the seam up with no further wiring.

Rules for anything in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Shared`:

- Name only `ISequencer`, never `IScheduler` or a Primitives sequencer type directly.
- Declare namespaces with the macro, so both leaves get their own:
  ```csharp
  #if REACTIVE_SHIM
  namespace ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.Observables;
  #else
  namespace ReactiveUI.Binding.Observables;
  #endif
  ```
- Never write a per-file `using ReactiveUI.Binding.*;` — those namespaces shift between leaves, so the
  import has to come from each csproj as a `<Using>` item (unshifted vs shifted).
- Only call scheduler APIs that exist in both flavours. The state-carrying
  `Schedule<TState>(TState, Func<scheduler, TState, IDisposable>)` is the shared shape; the plain
  `Action<TState>` overload exists on `ISequencer` but binds to recursive scheduling on `IScheduler`.

The platform packages follow the same shape: `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Shared` is compiled by
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>` and `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Reactive`, with namespaces shifting
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>` to `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive.<Platform>`. Neither platform leaf
references System.Reactive directly — `AnonymousObservable` and `ActionDisposable<TState>` in
`ReactiveUI.Binding.Platform.Shared` replace `Observable.Create`/`Disposable.Create`, and are compiled
privately into each platform assembly rather than added to the base library's surface.

### Platform Test Projects

Each platform package is tested by a pair: `ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Tests` owns the test source, and
`ReactiveUI.Binding.<Platform>.Tests.Reactive` has no source of its own — it links the lean project's `.cs`
so the same assertions run against both leaves. **The `.Reactive` suffix must come last in the name**, or
`ReactiveShim.props` will not recognise it and the mirror silently compiles against the lean namespaces.

WPF and WinForms tests target the windows TFMs and need the Windows Desktop runtime, so off Windows
`Directory.Build.targets` demotes them (`IsTestProject`, `IsTestingPlatformApplication`,
`TestingPlatformDotnetTestSupport` to false, `OutputType` to `Library`). They still compile on every leg;
they only execute on the Windows one. That demotion has to live in `Directory.Build.targets`, not
`Directory.Build.props` — the testing-platform props set those back to true after props are evaluated, and
launching a windows-TFM app on Linux fails the whole run with "Zero tests ran" even when every real test
passed. The MAUI pair is exempt: it targets the plain TFMs and runs everywhere.

Test fixtures that the product code finds by reflection must be `public` — the WinForms observer looks up
`{PropertyName}Changed` over public members only, so an `internal` fixture would pass for the wrong reason.

### Building Windows Targets off Windows

`MakePri.exe` and `cswinrt.exe` are native Windows binaries. On Linux/macOS the build reaches for them
through Wine, which crashes. `build/SkipMakePriOnNonWindows.targets` turns that pipeline off, imported
by a `Directory.Build.targets` in each Windows-desktop project (WPF and MAUI, both leaves) under
`Condition="!$([MSBuild]::IsOsPlatform('Windows'))"`, so real Windows builds still generate PRI.

**That `Directory.Build.targets` must sit in the project's own folder.** MSBuild discovers it by walking
up from the project directory, so moving it into a `*.Shared` source folder silently disables it — the
build keeps working right up until Wine starts. Each copy chains to the repository-level file with
`GetPathOfFileAbove`; without that chain it shadows `src/Directory.Build.targets` instead of adding to it.

### ConditionalWeakTable Symbol Caching

`MetadataExtractor.cs` uses `ConditionalWeakTable<Compilation, WellKnownSymbolsBox>` to cache resolved well-known type symbols per compilation, avoiding repeated `GetTypeByMetadataName` calls.

## Common Tasks

### Adding a New Generator Pipeline

1. Create value-equatable POCO in `Models/`
2. Add syntax predicate to `RoslynHelpers.cs`
3. Add extraction logic to `MetadataExtractor.cs`
4. Create invocation generator in `Invocations/` with `Register()` method
5. Wire into `BindingGenerator.cs` `Initialize()`
6. Add code generation to `CodeGeneration/CodeGenerator.cs`
7. Add snapshot test in generator test project
8. Accept snapshots by running the tests with `ACCEPT_SNAPSHOTS=1`

### Adding a New Analyzer Diagnostic

1. Add descriptor to `DiagnosticWarnings.cs` (shared file)
2. Update `AnalyzerReleases.Unshipped.md` in both projects
3. Create/update analyzer in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer/Analyzers/`
4. Add tests in `ReactiveUI.Binding.Analyzer.Tests/`
5. Use `AnalyzerTestHelper.GetDiagnosticsAsync<T>()` for testing

### Accepting Snapshot Changes

1. Run tests with the variable set: `ACCEPT_SNAPSHOTS=1 dotnet test --project tests/ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators.Tests/... -c Release`
2. Re-run tests without it to confirm the snapshots pass on their own

## What to Avoid

- **ISymbol/SyntaxNode in pipeline outputs** - breaks incremental caching
- **Runtime reflection** in generated code - breaks AOT compatibility
- **SyntaxFactory or a raw StringBuilder for code generation** - write through `SourceWriter` instead
- **Diagnostics in generator** - use separate analyzer project
- **LINQ in hot paths** - use manual loops (Roslyn convention)
- **Non-value-equatable models** in pipeline - breaks caching
- **APIs unavailable in netstandard2.0** in generator/analyzer projects

## Important Notes

- **Test and benchmark runtimes:** .NET 10.0 and 11.0
- **Generator + Analyzer targets:** netstandard2.0 (Roslyn requirement)
- **Runtime library targets:** net8.0;net9.0;net10.0;net11.0;net462;net47;net471;net472;net48;net481
- **No shallow clones:** Repository requires full clone for Nerdbank.GitVersioning
- **Where the analyzers ship:** `ReactiveUI.Binding` and `ReactiveUI.Binding.Reactive` each pack the generator
  and analyzer DLLs into `analyzers/dotnet/roslyn4.8/cs` and `analyzers/dotnet/roslyn4.13/cs`, so referencing a
  runtime package is all a consumer needs. `ReactiveUI.Binding.SourceGenerators` is a compatibility package that
  ships only the MSBuild props and targets: a second copy of the same assemblies under a different package root
  loads as a second generator and emits every dispatch file twice, which fails the consumer's build

**Philosophy:** Generate zero-reflection, AOT-compatible property observation and binding code at compile-time. Support all ReactiveUI platform notification mechanisms. Fall back to runtime expression analysis only when compile-time analysis is not possible.
