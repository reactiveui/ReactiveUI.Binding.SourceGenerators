/// An Android view is not observable in general: it implements no change-notification interface, and most of
/// its properties are plain CLR properties that change silently. A handful of widgets do raise an event for one
/// property, and that handful is the whole of what this mechanism reaches - the runtime engine keeps the same
/// list and scores everything outside it zero, so a property that is not here falls through to whatever else
/// the type carries rather than being observed badly.
/// </para>
/// <para>
/// Keyed by property name alone, which is enough: no two widgets in the list report different events for the
/// same property name, and a property only resolves at all on a type that declares it, so matching the name
/// implies the declaring widget and therefore the event.
/// </para>
